The Meraki Dashboard is an intuitive dashboard which is used to manage the
Cisco Meraki's cloud-managed platform (https://meraki.cisco.com).

is used to interact with the Meraki Dashboard using the REST API conventions.

of managing the Meraki's cloud-managed devices and any other utilities
such as pre-defined classes or functions which are used among those workflows.
